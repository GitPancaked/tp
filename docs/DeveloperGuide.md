### BuildManager


## Product scope
### Target user profile

This product is targeted towards PC building enthusiasts and professional System builds who have a need and want to 
keep track of their PC builds. It is optimized for users to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI).

### Value proposition

This product helps builders to keep track of their PC builds and their components. It also helps them to keep track of
their total power consumption and the total cost of their builds. Compatibility of components is also checked to ensure
that the build is able to function properly..
